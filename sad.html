Your not that smart but still you was so nice to me.Things started changing from last year.The way you started minimizing our interaction convo it was heartbroking to me.I m same from day one but your changed so much.I m really sorry for misbehaving with you abusing evrything that i did in name of fun.I know im mannersless but i have to do it all to gain your attention.Now let it be.I never intented to hurt you or trigger your ego my dear frnd.
Now all i understand is that our frndship is worthy of nothing.Its full of memories we had which i will always cherish and thak you for those memories on my part.I know you wanted me to grow my best.You want to see me have a great career ahead.You always encouraged me for that and thank you so much kannu for that.Just the way you feel for me similary i also want you to have a happy life a happiest life a bestest life for you.You dseserve alllllllll happpinessssss becossss yourrrr  my pumkin pumkin.

Your the most preittest thing i ever saw you know.MUJHE TAJ MAHAL DEKHNA THAAAA BUT usse pehle i saw you.Now i guess even tajmahal cant even bit u in terms of beauty.MY pretty little baby!!
Unfortunately jaise dudh ki expiry hoti hai our frndship also came to an expiry date.AND YOURRRRRRR SO BAADDD that your not even discussing this important thing with me like a mature.SUCH a meanyyyyyyyyy.....
I want to let you know that im not going to text you ever or call you or talk with you.Im not kiding this time okiieeeee.i swear.you can add me on linkedin you can see me grow there......
